The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Using passenger data (such as age, gender, class, etc.), the goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers

Building multiple machine learning models

Model evaluation and comparison using different metrics

Visualization of insights and learning curves
